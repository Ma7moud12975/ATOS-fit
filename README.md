## 📦 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the app running locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or later)
-   [DFX SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/) (The command-line interface for the Internet Computer)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Ma7moud12975/Fitness-Tracker-web-v1.git
    cd Fitness-Tracker-web-v1
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the local IC replica:**
    Open a new terminal window and run the following command. This starts a local, single-node version of the Internet Computer.
    ```sh
    dfx start --background --clean
    ```

4.  **Deploy the canisters:**
    This command registers, builds, and deploys the application to your local replica.
    ```sh
    dfx deploy
    ```

5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```


6.  **Open the app:**
    Navigate to the local server URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:3000` or a similar port). The application will be running and connected to your local replica.
